#  üìùAbout The Project
NotJetpackJoyride is an attempt to recreate JetPack Joyride within Unity. The game features a character who avoids obstacles while trying to pickup coins and travel as far as possible. The catch of the game is the player's ability to fly up and down using the jetpack. This project was done over an 11 week period in which most work was done within a 4 hour class. 

## My Contribution 
Most of my contribution to this project was through the eyes of a Project/Product Manager, where I spent most of my time assigning tasks, deciding what each classmate should do next in the project, and brainstorming more ideas with the class to add to the game.
